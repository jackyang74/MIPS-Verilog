## INTRODUCTION ##**SimMIPS** is a embedded system based on FPGA. It consists of CPU, peripherals, diverse interfaces and corresponding C-based application code.The CPU is a simplified version of MIPS32 4Kc processor and is implemented in Verilog. As a subset of MIPS32 Release 1, the ISA of our CPU covers the commonly used assemble instructions generated by GNU GCC.Features of CPU as follows:  * 32bit RISC architecture  * 5 stage pipeline  * dynamic branch predictor  * MMU with ITLB and DTLB  * Bus Interface Unit(BIU) with [Wishbone bus protocol][2]  * Hardware Multiply-Divide Unit(MDU)  * Almost fully functional System Control Coprocessor(CP0)As for peripherals, we provide UART, SPI Master Controller, Timer, RTC(real time controller), GPIO(General Purpose IO), PIC(Programmable Interrupt Controller) and VGA Display Controller. The storage system is composed of SDRAM, SRAM, FPGA BlockRAM and SD card wired by SPI bus.Apart from hardware implementation on FPGA, there is still a long way to go before launching Hello World program. We develop boot software system to assist development. You can run **BootClient** on PC to transmit an elf-format executable program over serial line which is connected between PC and FPGA board. Then the **BootRom** in FPGA will store the program in memory and execute it.## USAGE ##Now this project will be used as a experimental platform in department of Computer Science in Nanjing University. Computer System Comprehensive Experiment course is compulsory for juniors. Experiments in multiple fields of Computer Science, including computer architecture, operating system and compiler design will conducted on SimMIPS in this course.You could also use SimMIPS in your project as a simple embedded processor for computing and controlling.## REQUIREMENTS ##Our project only supports Altera DE2-70 now. In the future we will add Nexys 4. It would be better if you have either one of these two boards. Other boards are OK and you may need to do port work yourself. Please refer to [SimMIPS wiki][1] when you encounter problems.## MORE DETAILS ##For more details, welcome to [SimMIPS wiki][1][1]:https://github.com/jackyang74/SimMIPS/wiki[2]:http://opencores.org/opencores,wishbone
