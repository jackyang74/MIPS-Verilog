SimMIPS============## INTRODUCTION ##SimMIPS is a embedded system based on FPGA. It consists of CPU, peripherals, diverse  interfaces and corresponding C-based application code.The CPU is a simplified version of MIPS32 4Kc processor and is implemented in Verilog. As a subset of MIPS32 Release 1, the ISA of our CPU covers the commonly used assemble instructions generated by GNU GCC.Features of CPU as follows:  * 32bit RISC architecture  * 5 stage pipeline  * dynamic branch predictor  * MMU with ITLB and DTLB  * Wishbone open source bus  * Hardware Multiply-Divide Unit(MDU)  * As for peripherals, we provide uart, spi master,   ## REQUIREMENTS ##Our project only support Altera DE2-70 now. In the future we will add Nexys 4. It would be better if you have either one of these two boards. Other boards are OK and you may need to do port work yourself. Please refer to [SimMIPS wiki][1] when you encounter problems.## MORE DETAILS ##For more details, welcome to [SimMIPS wiki][1][1]:https://github.com/jackyang74/SimMIPS/wiki
